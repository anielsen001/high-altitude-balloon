## Assumptions

This is basically just a restate of the execlleent Washington U reference below.

The Earth is a sphere of radius 6,378.1370 km, this is the equatorial radius of the elliptical earth.

The slant range $s$ to the horizon
$$
s = \sqrt{(R+h)^2 - R^2}
$$
rewritten
$$
s = \sqrt{2Rh + h^2}
$$

$\ell$ is the distance along the ground. We assume that $h \ll R$ so $s \approx \ell$  and 
$$
s \approx \ell = \sqrt{2Rh + h^2} \approx \sqrt{2Rh}
$$ 
often restated as
$$
s = k \sqrt{h}
$$
and found on-line with $k=1.22459$ with $h$ in feet and $s$ in miles.
