The Earth’s magnetic field is typically not measured at these altitudes, it’s usually measured with satellites or low-altitude (&lt;10kft) aircraft for anomaly surveys.\nThe goal is to build a pico-balloon payload that can circumnavigate the Earth using a low power tracker and a PNI RM3100 magnetometer. We had an opportunity to launch the first version of the payload during the total eclipse in April 2024, Section 1, but we lost contact with the payload telemetry.",
