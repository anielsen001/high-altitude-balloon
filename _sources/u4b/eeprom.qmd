From the manual
```
The “disk” on U4B is implemented as a FAT12-ish file structure on the 128K I2C EEPROM chip.
There are 1024 blocks, each of which is 128 bytes long. A program that is longer than 128K is
stored in multiple blocks. Normally these would be consecutive blocks but in case a large enough
consecutive memory area is not available for the size of the file being saved, it will be split into
smaller pieces that are spread around the disk and later re-assembled. 

```

Trying to mount EEPROM file as loop device

```bash
sudo mount -t vfat -o loop EEPROM /mnt/tmp
```

But this does not work.
