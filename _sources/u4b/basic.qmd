## Default program

This is the default program

```basic
10 GPS 360
TELE
GOTO 10
```

## Testing program

This is a program for testing. Each print statement prints out the current time before the message.

The TELE statement waits until the proper time to transmit, which could be up to 10 minutes.

C is the transmission count

```basic
LET CH = 109
LET HP = 1
LET C = 0
PRINT "HOST USB:    #US"
PRINT "HIGH POWER:  #HP"
PRINT "FREQUENCY:   #FQ"
PRINT "CHANNEL:     #CH"
PRINT "CALLSIGN:    #CS"
PRINT "TEMPERATURE: #TK"
10 GPS 360
PRINT "LLH: #LT #LN #AT"
PRINT "GPS: VALID: #GV LOCK: #GL SPEED: #GS CALIB: #CL"
LET C = C + 1
TELE C


GOTO 10
```

## Issues

### Firmware 1.00.05

the CH variable prints differently than expected. I think the tag version and non-tagged version should both work but does not appear to.

```text
$ PRINT CH
325
$ PRINT "#CH"

$ PRINT "CHANNEL: #CH"
CHANNEL:
$ PRINT CH
325
$
```
