## Default program

This is the default program

```basic
10 GPS 360
TELE
GOTO 10
```

## Testing program

This is a program for testing. Each print statement prints out the current time before the message.

There's a different syntax running from command line vs in a program. 

- in a program use 
```basic
RUN "TEST"
```
- at command line use
```basic
RUN TEST
```

The TELE statement waits until the proper time to transmit, which could be up to 10 minutes.

C is the transmission count - increment everytime a transmission occurs. used to see if transmissions are missing. if balloon loses power this will reset
N is a counter used for the BLINK program to set the number of times to blink the led


### initialization program 

```BASIC
LET CH = 109
LET HP = 1
LET C = 0
PRINT "HOST USB:    #US"
PRINT "HIGH POWER:  #HP"
PRINT "FREQUENCY:   #FQ"
PRINT "CHANNEL:     #CH"
PRINT "CALLSIGN:    #CS"
PRINT "TEMPERATURE: #TK"
```

### Blink LED program

The value N is used to control how often to flash

```BASIC
PRINT "BLINK #VN"
FOR I = 1 TO N
OUT 19 1
DELAY 100
OUT 19 0
DELAY 100
NEXT
```

### Main program

```basic
RUN INIT
10 GPS 360
PRINT "LLH: #LT #LN #AT"
PRINT "GPS: VALID: #GV LOCK: #GL SPEED: #GS CALIB: #CL"
LET C = C + 1
TELE C


GOTO 10
```

## Issues

### Firmware 1.00.05

the CH variable prints differently than expected. I think the tag version and non-tagged version should both work but does not appear to.

```text
$ PRINT CH
325
$ PRINT "#CH"

$ PRINT "CHANNEL: #CH"
CHANNEL:
$ PRINT CH
325
$
```
