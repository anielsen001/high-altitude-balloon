10 GPS 360
TELE

## Testing program

This is a program for testing. Each print statement prints out the current time before the message.

The TELE statement waits until the proper time to transmit, which could be up to 10 minutes.

```basic
LET CH = 109
LET HP = 1
PRINT "HOST USB:    #US"
PRINT "HIGH POWER:  #HP"
PRINT "FREQUENCY:   #FQ"
PRINT "CHANNEL:     #CH"
PRINT "CALLSIGN:    #CS"
PRINT "TEMPERATURE: #TK"
10 GPS 360
PRINT "LLH: #LT #LN #AT"
PRINT "GPS: VALID: #GV LOCK: #GL SPEED: #GS CALIB: #CL"
TELE
GOTO 10
```
