## connect to u4b via usb

connect the u4b to the computer with a usb cable. Check for the device and use `screen` to log attach to a terminal.

```bash
screen /dev/ttyACM0 9600
```

screen user's guide: https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html

The manual discusses the interface.

Ctrl-q is supposed to quit, but not working. - need to do Ctrl-a-q

## GPS antenna

From the hardware manual, page 12

```
The HF antenna needs 1/4-wavelength on each leg (for example, each leg is 5m for 20m
operation). A typical flight configuration has the top end of the top leg tied to the balloon, and the
U4B payload suspended directly in the middle of the dipole.
The GPS antenna can be made of simple #28 (0.3mm) enameled wire; a 1/4-wave at 1575Mhz is
about 45mm. The feedline consists of 1-inch of twisted wire, about 6 turns works well.
```

```{python}
#| label: gps wavelength
from scipy import constants as spc
freq_l1 = 1575.42e6 # Hz

wavelength = spc.c/freq_l1

half_wavelength = wavelength/2.0
quarter_wavelength = wavelength/4.0

print(f'half wavelength: {half_wavelength*1000} millimeters')
print(f'quarter wavelength: {quarter_wavelength*1000} millimeters')

```

half wavelength: 95.14683639918243 millimeters
quarter wavelength: 47.57341819959122 millimeters


## HF Antenna

### dummy load

use a 50 Ohm resistor across the lead pads

### dipole

Frequency of channel is: 14097060

```{python}
#| label: wavelength 20m band
from scipy import constants as spc

freq_hf = 14097060
wavelength = spc.c/freq_hf

half_wavelength = wavelength/2.0
quarter_wavelength = wavelength/4.0

print(f'half wavelength: {half_wavelength} meters')
print(f'quarter wavelength: {quarter_wavelength} meters')
```

half wavelength: 10.63315535296012 meters
quarter wavelength: 5.31657767648006 meters = 16.7323 ft = 200.76 inches

Antenna wire - what gauge? people are using 36 AWG
What fishing line support to use.

## Power

3.3V min to 5.5V max - true max is likely 6.0V 

### Battery holder

with NiMH 4.3 V fully charged output

### Solar


### USB
